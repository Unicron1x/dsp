â€‹    The root difference between the Bayesian and Frequentist approach to statistics has to do with competing definitions of the term probability.  

+ Frequentist are concerned with the frequency of an event in an infite set of repeated experiments.  Bayesians are more concerned with probaility derived from prior knowledge of an event and continually updating one's assessment as new information becomes available.  

+ Frequentist also tend to use a rigid set of models, with varying data, whereas Bayesians believe the data is fixed with varying models.  
+ Bayesians use probability  for both the hypotheses and the data, versus Frequentist who do not give probabilities for hypothesis.
